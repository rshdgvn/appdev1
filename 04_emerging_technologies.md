## Purpose  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require **human intelligence**—such as learning, reasoning, decision-making, and language understanding.  

**Main Goals of AI**:
- Automating repetitive or complex tasks  
- Personalizing learning and user experiences  
- Enhancing efficiency and data-driven decisions  
- Freeing up human time for creative and strategic activities
